          <h2>Virtual Assistant</h2>
          <p>
            <span>The Reason</span><br />This application was built to practice
            and showcase skills in JavaScript. This app allowed me to create
            something that relied entirely on user interaction.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>The Lesson</span><br />I learned a great deal about creating
            something that could be customized by the user. I learned that user
            experience is something that can be difficult to maintain while
            still trying to do something unique.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>The Success</span><br />This app is easy to understand and the
            interface is clean and familiar. The user has control over the color
            pallet and is free to interact with the virtual assistant in any way
            they wish.

        <article class="projContent">
          <h2>DoWhat</h2>
          <p>
            <span>The Reason</span><br />This is the first web application I
            built. It's a simple application that allows for a bit of fun user
            interaction. I wanted to create an engaging application even though
            I did not have as much experience at the time with JavaScript and
            DOM manipulation.
          </p>

          <p>
            <span>The Lesson</span><br />I learned a great deal about
            conditional statements by creating this app. It also allowed me to
            understand the basics of UX.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>The Success</span><br />This app functions really well and
            gives users an action to take. It successfully goes beyond an open
            it and close it app; it challenges the user to do something outside
            of the app while still bringing them back for more.

      <article class="portProj slayerTap">
        <header class="projImg">
          <img src="img/slayertapapp.png" id="st" alt="Slayer Tap App" />
        </header>

        <article class="projContent">
          <h2>Slayer Tap</h2>
          <p>
            <span>The Reason</span><br />I wanted to do something that involved
            more variables and more functions. Slayer Tap dives heavily into UI
            and UX by giving users a larger deal of functionality. This also
            allowed me to grow my knowledge in photoshop design, more complex
            functions, and larger conditionals.
          </p>

          <p>
            <span>The Lesson</span><br />The layout was very difficult to
            manipulate due to lack of focus on UI first. My goal going into this
            was functionality first and UI second. I no longer think this way;
            the layout and design heading the development makes for an easier
            time in the polishing phase and programming phase of the app.
          </p>

          <p>
            <span>The Success</span><br />The UI turned out pretty nice it
            functions exactly how I envisoned it when I was drawing the idea out
            on whiteboard. This was also a lot of fun to create and really
            helped me to solidify my passion for design and user experience.
